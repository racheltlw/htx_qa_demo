The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.

"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

"This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

"The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.

Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:

The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.","

"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.","

"Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask).

Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

"In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of  their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.

If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene.

If the patient is wearing a facemask, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient’s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).

After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE.

EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/infection-prevention-control-faq.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Finfection-prevention-control-faq.html,Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),,,
"Standard Precautions should be followed when caring for any patient, regardless of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If the patient is afebrile (temperature is less than 100.0oF) and otherwise without even mild symptoms* that might be consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath), then precautions specific to COVID-19 are not required. However, until the patient is determined to be without such symptoms, HCP should wear all recommended PPE for the patient encounter. If the primary evaluation confirms the patient is without symptoms, management and need for any Transmission-Based Precautions should be based with the condition for which they are being evaluated (e.g., patient colonized with a drug-resistant organism), rather than potential exposure to COVID-19.

This public health response is an important opportunity to reinforce the importance of strict adherence to Standard Precautions during all patient encounters. Standard Precautions are based on the principles that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. The application of Standard Precautions is determined by the nature of the HCP-patient interaction and the extent of anticipated blood, body fluids, and pathogen exposure. For example, a facemask and eye protection should be worn during the care of any patient if splashes, sprays, or coughs could occur during the patient encounter. Similarly, gloves should be worn if contact with body fluids, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin are anticipated.

*Note: In addition to cough and shortness of breath, nonspecific symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea have been noted as initial symptoms in some cases of COVID-19. These symptoms can have several alternative explanations; however, failure to identify and implement proper precautions in a healthcare setting for persons infected with COVID-19 can contribute to widespread transmission in that facility due to the presence of susceptible patients and close interactions with healthcare personnel. For this reason, a lower temperature of 100.0oF and the inclusion of mild and non-specific symptoms should be used by healthcare settings evaluating these patients to increase the ability to detect even mild cases of COVID-19.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/infection-prevention-control-faq.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Finfection-prevention-control-faq.html,Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),,,

"Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
 



Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,World Health Organization (WHO),,,
"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

"Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:

Older adults (65+)
Individuals with compromised immune systems
Individuals who have serious chronic medical conditions like:
Heart disease
Diabetes
Lung disease
If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or health condition, it is important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease, including: 

Isolate at home and practice social distancing.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, or having been in a public place.
Avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay away from large gatherings and crowds.
Consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks.
It is also important that you listen to public health officials who may recommend community actions to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, especially if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.

As in any public health event, our Medical and Health Coordination Center has been activated and is coordinating response efforts across the state and preparing for possible community transmission. 
In coordination with the CDC, state and local health departments, we are actively responding to cases of COVID-19. 
The Public Health Department is supporting hospitals and local public health laboratories in the collection of specimens and testing for COVID-19. 
California activated the State Operations Center to its highest level to coordinate response efforts across the state. 
Governor Gavin Newsom requested the Legislature make up to $20 million available for state government to respond to the spread of COVID-19. 
California made available some of its emergency planning reserves of 21 million N95 filtering facepiece masks for use in certain health care settings to ease shortages of personal protective equipment. 
We are providing information, guidance documents, and technical support to local health departments, health care facilities, providers, schools, universities, colleges, elder care and congregate living facilities and childcare facilities across California. 
California obtained approval to provide meal service during school closures to minimize potential exposure to the coronavirus. These meals are available at no cost to low-income children – and are not required to be served in a group setting – to ensure kids receive nutritious meals while schools are temporarily closed. 
The state directed mass gatherings be postponed or cancelled to slow the spread of the virus. 
The Franchise Tax Board is providing a 90-day extension to file California tax returns for taxpayers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
CalTrans launched a statewide educational campaign on more than 700 electronic highway signs, urging all Californians to be more diligent about containing the spread of the virus.  
The state is allowing local and state legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still meeting state transparency requirements.  
The California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency released guidance for homeless assistance providers in the state. 
The California Department of Public Health is coordinating with federal authorities and local health departments that have implemented screening, monitoring and, in some cases, quarantine of returning travelers.  
In coordination with state and local health departments, we have actively managed suspect and confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients. 
California worked in partnership with the federal government to aid in the safe return of 962 Californians from the Grand Princess cruise ship.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans.

Bats are considered as natural hosts of these viruses yet several other species of animals are also known to be a source. For instance, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats. More information on coronaviruses can be found on the ECDC factsheet.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"The novel coronavirus detected in China is genetically closely related to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died.

The current COVID-19 outbreak caused around 7 000 reported cases in China during the first month after initial reports (January 2020), with a further 80 000 cases reported globally during the second month (February 2020). Of these first 87 000 cases, about 3 000 died. Cases are now being detected in Europe and across the globe. See the situation updates for the latest available information. 

While the viruses that cause both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are transmitted from person-to-person and may cause similar symptoms, the two viruses are very different and do not behave in the same way. ECDC estimates that between 15 000 and 75 000 people die prematurely due to causes associated with seasonal influenza each year in the EU, the UK, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This is approximately 1 in every 1 000 people who are infected. By comparison, the current estimated mortality rate for COVID-19 is 20-30 per 1 000 people.

Despite the relatively low mortality rate for seasonal influenza, many people die from the disease due to the large number of people who contract it each year. The concern about COVID-19 is that, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease. It also appears to be as transmissible as influenza if not more so. As it is a new virus, nobody has prior immunity which in theory means that the entire human population is potentially susceptible to COVID-19 infection.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"Preliminary findings indicate that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 20-30 per thousand people diagnosed. This is significantly less than the 2003 SARS outbreak. However, it is much higher than the mortality rate for seasonal influenza.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"While animals are the original source of the virus, it is now spreading from person to person (human-to-human transmission). There is not enough epidemiological information at this time to determine how easily and sustainably this virus spreads between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three more. The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets that people sneeze, cough, or exhale. The virus can also survive for several hours on surfaces such as tables and door handles.

The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms) is currently estimated at between two and 14 days. At this stage, we know that the virus can be transmitted when people who are infected show flu-like symptoms such as coughing.  There is evidence suggesting that transmission can occur from an infected person with no symptoms; however, uncertainties remain about the effect of transmission by non symptomatic persons on the epidemic.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,

Of these, fewer than 3% developed severe or critical disease.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. That said, current evidence suggests that severity of illness among pregnant women after COVID-19 infection is similar to that in non-pregnant adult COVID-19 cases, and there is no data that suggests infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby occurring during pregnancy. ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"There is no specific treatment for this disease, so healthcare providers treat the clinical symptoms (e.g. fever, difficulty breathing) of patients.

"Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Countries across the EU/EEA might be in different scenarios, even within the same country, and testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level.

National authorities may decide to only test subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or any other criteria. As a rational approach, national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups:

hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections;
cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals in order to assess the extent of virus circulation in the population;
elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,

Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings.

It is also recommended to stay 1 metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms, to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,

"If you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people, but there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent you from being infected with the virus. In fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes.",https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers,European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),,,
"There are currently no vaccines against human coronaviruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19. This is why it is very important to prevent infection and to contain further spread of the virus.

The development of vaccines takes time. Several pharmaceutical companies are working on vaccine candidates. It will, however, take months or years before any vaccine can be widely used, as it needs to undergo extensive testing to determine its safety and efficacy.

However, the extent to which children play a role in the transmission of the virus is still unknown. Due to this uncertainty, it is especially important to encourage children to wash their hands carefully to reduce any possible risk of them becoming infected themselves, and then of passing on the virus. If children do become ill, they should be strictly isolated at home.

Depending on local circumstances, local authorities may decide to temporarily close schools and daycare centres to reduce transmission.

This declaration of a pandemic by WHO has no direct impact on the preparation and measures being conducted in Germany. Germany has taken the situation very seriously from the outset and also conducted the same measures that WHO is now emphasising once again. These are:

Inform the population on the risks posed by the disease

Inform the population on how each individual can protect him/herself and appeal to everyone to do so

Do everything to find, isolate, test and treat every case, as well as locate every contact person, so as to prevent further spread of the disease

Prepare hospitals and clinics for the emergency situation that is to be expected

Prepare medical personnel and protect them from infection

Help each other and take care of one another.

On 30 January 2020, WHO had already declared the situation to be a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern, (PHEIC)” and issued recommendations to contain and control the outbreak.",https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.html,Bundesministerium für Gesundheit,,,
"On 11 February, the novel coronavirus that had provisionally been known as 2019-nCoV, was given a new name: SARS-CoV-2. The acronym SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. The name denotes its close relationship to the SARS coronavirus that caused an epidemic in 2002/2003.

The respiratory disease that can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 has also been given a new name. It is now called Covid-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019).",https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.html,Bundesministerium für Gesundheit,,,
"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person. Droplet infection is the main mode of transmission. Transmission can take place directly, from person-to-person, or indirectly through contact between hands and the mucous membranes of the mouth, the nose or the conjunctiva of the eyes. There have been reports of persons who were infected by individuals who had only shown slight or non-specific symptoms of disease. The percentage of asymptomatic cases is unclear; according to data from WHO and China, however, such cases do not play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.html,Bundesministerium für Gesundheit,,,

"Among the cases reported to date, in four out of five cases infection was mild. In some patients, the virus can lead to severe illness, including difficult breathing, and to pneumonia. Deaths have mainly occurred among patients who were elderly and/or had prior underlying chronic illnesses.

"Currently, hospitals and family physicians decide who will be tested. They base their decision on the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute. According to these recommendations, symptoms such as fever, a sore throat and respiratory complaints, on their own, are not sufficient. The person must additionally have had contact with an infected person, or have spent time in a region in which the virus was proven to exist over large areas.

Testing should be done only if disease symptoms are present. If you are healthy, a test will not be able to tell you whether or not you will fall ill in the coming days. At the same time, this puts an unnecessary strain on our testing capacities.",https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/press/2020/coronavirus.html,Bundesministerium für Gesundheit,,,

Treatment of the infection depends on the severity of the disease presentation (e.g administering oxygen, maintaining fluid balance, if necessary administering antibiotics to combat bacterial co-infections) and also includes the treatment of relevant underlying chronic illnesses.

TNP understands the suspects are still at large and investigations are ongoing.  After telling his family that he was going out to buy drinks, a man went to meet his girlfriend's former boyfriend to resolve their differences. The meeting on Wednesday evening landed the 20-year-old in hospital with serious injuries after he was attacked by a group of men. His older brother, 24, told Shin Min Daily News that his family later found out he had agreed to meet his girlfriend's ex-lover at a void deck. To his horror, the victim, who was not named, realised the meeting was an ambush when four to five men set upon him, the brother said. The family was shocked to see the victim bleeding profusely from multiple slash wounds when he returned 15 minutes after stepping out. SURGERY The father told Lianhe Wanbao his son was slashed on the forehead and suffered a deep cut on his left arm that exposed the wrist bone, for which surgery was required. The police told The New Paper yesterday they were alerted to a case of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon at Block 106 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh at about 6pm on Wednesday. A 20-year-old man was taken conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, they added. The police also said that preliminary investigations indicate the victim knew one of his assailants. TNP understands the suspects are still at large. Investigations are ongoing. This incident is the latest in a spate of violent attacks, including a murder, during the circuit breaker period. Shin Min reported yesterday that at least eight police vehicles were at the scene. Two dogs from the police's K-9 unit were also present. Lianhe Wanbao reported that the attack left a 20- to 30-metre trail of blood along the void deck at Block 106 and at the staircase on the second storey. The father, who declined to be named, told the Chinese evening daily: ""My son was knocking on the door, anxiously asking me to open it. ""Initially, he did not want to tell me how he got hurt. He told me what had happened only after I continued to ask him about it."" The father said he suspected his son's love rival of the attack. He also claimed the ex-lover had just been released from prison. The brother told Shin Min the victim has previously squabbled with his rival over his girlfriend. Residents in the area said a group of four to five people were shouting along the covered walkway. Some said the victim lived on the eighth storey. A 41-year-old resident, who wanted to be known only as Mr Hamid, told Wanbao: ""I heard (the victim) had escaped to the lift lobby on the second storey before falling to the floor from exhaustion. Neighbours then called the police."" Mr Hamid, who said he is a distant relative of the victim, added that he had seen four or five youths loitering at the void deck at about 3pm that day.

The police told AsiaOne they are looking into a case of voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapon. During the scuffle, their 31-year-old brother not only lost half a tooth but also sustained cuts on his right arm and under his chin, both of which required stitches. According to the injured man, his younger brother had been drinking at home when he became increasingly agitated. When his older brothers tried to appease him, the drunk man got even more upset and brandished a knife, waving it around the house. Their attempts to stop him resulted in injuries in the younger two siblings, as well as a 29-year-old man who was visiting their home. In an interview with the Chinese evening paper, a neighbour recounted how they had heard a heated argument between the three siblings coming from next door. Shouts and screams were heard at times.

" SINGAPORE - One of the two alleged offenders linked to an attack on Sunday (May 10), in which the injured victim was found in Bishan, is said to have reoffended while out on bail. Prior to Sunday's incident, Gervan Wong Jun Heng, 24, had been hauled to court earlier and handed 24 charges for offences, including methamphetamine consumption and two other counts of assault. Wong and Andre Chen Si'en, 29, appeared in court on Tuesday over their alleged involvement in the attack on Sunday that had left Mr Douglas Wong Wei Hao, 30, with multiple injuries, including a deformed left arm, puncture wounds on both legs and wounds on his head. The pair were each charged with one count of using a weapon to cause grievous hurt to Mr Douglas Wong at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery at around 3am on Sunday. Gervan Wong is accused of attacking him with a metal baton, while Chen is said to have done so with a knuckleduster. Court documents did not state how Mr Douglas Wong ended up in Bishan. The police said in a statement on Monday that they were informed about Mr Douglas Wong's attack at around 5.40am on Sunday after he was found injured in Bishan Street 12. Officers from Jurong Police Division managed to establish the identities of the two alleged offenders through ground inquiries and images from police cameras. Officers arrested the men within 10 hours after the report was lodged. Gervan Wong now has three pending assault charges in all. On Oct 27 last year, he is said to have ganged up with two other men to attack Mr Eugene Aathar, 25, and Mr Ong Hian Wei, 34, at the basement 3 carpark of Marina Bay Sands at around 6am. Gervan Wong, Jovi Wan Shao Xiong, 22, and Kenji Pong Jia Rong, 24, are accused of using a knife to slash the pair. In another case, Gervan Wong allegedly used an extendable baton to hit Mr Yuen De Sheng's head and upper lip in a room at the Studio M Hotel in Nanson Road, near Robertson Quay, at around 8am on May 11 last year. Lawyer Jonathan Wong represents Gervan Wong, while Chen is represented by Mr Foo Ho Chew. Mr Foo told the court on Tuesday that Mr Douglas Wong had allegedly raped a woman whom his client knows and that she is now ""traumatised"". Court documents did not reveal details about this purported incident. Of Sunday's incident, the police said that they do not tolerate ""such brazen acts of violence and blatant disregard of the law"". They added: ""We will spare no effort to apprehend such offenders and deal with them severely in accordance with the law.""

" SINGAPORE - A former director of Singapore Zam Zam restaurant in North Bridge Road, who masterminded a 2015 attack against a supervisor of rival eatery Victory restaurant next door, was sentenced on Monday (May 11) to six years' jail and six strokes of the cane. Before sentencing Zackeer Abbass Khan, District Judge Mathew Joseph said the case was a reminder that one should not allow one's anger to cloud one's judgment as the ""resulting consequences can be severe"". The judge also said there was ""no place in our society for gratuitous violence."" In March, Judge Joseph found Zackeer, 49, and former safety officer Anwer Ambiya Kadir Maideen, 50, guilty of one count each of engaging in a conspiracy to cause grievous hurt to Mr Liakath Ali Mohamed Ibrahim with a weapon. The attack took place at around 10pm on Aug 26, 2015. He also convicted Zackeer of criminal intimidation as he had threatened to injure Mr Liakath, then 52, on Aug 22 that year. On Monday, Anwer also admitted to being a senior member of a secret society. He had joined the gang in 1990 and was a ""fighter"" there. Judge Joseph then sentenced him to a total of 5½ years' jail. Zackeer and Anwer were the last two people involved in the case to be convicted. Others, including secret society member Joshua Navindran Surainthiran, who was 23 when he slashed Mr Liakath, have already been dealt with in court. In November 2016, Joshua was sentenced to 6½ years' jail and six strokes of the cane for the slashing and other offences. In their submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Wen Hsien and Claire Poh stated that the ""genesis of this ill-will"" could be traced to 2005 when Zackeer and Mr Liakath were business partners. The court heard that after the business failed, Mr Liakath joined Victory Restaurant in 2014 and created problems for Zam Zam by pulling customers away and reporting its staff to the authorities. The DPPs added: ""Things came to a head on Aug 22, 2015, when the police arrived at the restaurants to advise them to refrain from touting. Zackeer believed that this was a set-up by the victim, and that he ratted on Zam Zam employees to the police. ""Incensed, Zackeer threatened the victim that he would hit or kill him within a week."" Zackeer later asked Anwer to arrange an attack on Mr Liakath and offered money to get the job done. The court heard that Joshua, in his statements to the authorities, had said Anwer called him on Aug 23, 2015, and offered him $2,000 to slash Mr Liakath's face. At around 10pm three days later, Joshua confronted Mr Liakath at a bridge between Rochor Canal Road and Sungei Road and slashed his face with a knife. Mr Liakath suffered a 7-cm cut over his right upper lip, which extended to his right cheek, and a part of the cut went through to the inner surface of the lip. He is now left with a permanent scar. The DPPs said that, after the slashing, Zackeer handed $2,000 to Anwer to pay Joshua. Anwer transferred $1,700 to Joshua's bank account. He had given Joshua $200 as initial payment on Aug 23, 2015. Joshua, Anwer and Zackeer were arrested on Sept 21, 2015, the court heard. Mr Liakath, who suffered deep cuts to his nose and right upper lip in the attack, is now left with a permanent scar. PHOTO: LIANHE WANBAO Defence lawyer Peter Keith Fernando, who represented Anwer, told the court on Monday that his client has been an inactive member of the secret society for some time. Anwer, who also addressed the court, told Judge Joseph that he was remorseful and wanted to mend his ways. He was offered bail of $60,000 and ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on July 6 to begin serving his jail term. Zackeer's lawyer, Mr Sarbrinder Singh, said his client had not committed a gang-related offence and stressed that Joshua had not acted on instructions from a gang. Zackeer intends to appeal against the judge's decisions and his bail has been set at $75,000. For playing a role to voluntarily cause grievous hurt with a weapon, an offender can be jailed for up to 15 years' jail and fined or caned. Anwer cannot be caned as he is 50 years old.

"Lim Wee Ming, 46, got into a dispute with the older man, who, he claimed, had bumped into him.  Accusing an elderly e-scooter rider of bumping into him, Lim Wee Ming, 46, got into a dispute with the man, swore at him and punched him in the eye. The blow caused Mr Goh Sung Beng, 68, to later lose sight in his left eye. For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Lim was yesterday jailed for a year and ordered to pay $5,258.46 in compensation. Lim, who works as a packer, had also pleaded guilty to using abusive words towards Mr Goh. At about 11am on Dec 6, 2017, Mr Goh was riding his e-scooter near Block 289 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3, when he saw Lim walking towards him. They passed each other and Lim told Mr Goh that he had bumped into him. The older man denied this and vulgarities were exchanged as the dispute grew heated. Mr Goh then raised his walking stick, which was hanging on his e-scooter, and swung it around. The stick did not hit Lim, but he punched Mr Goh, causing the latter to bleed from his left eye. A witness, who came forward to stop the assault, had to hold Lim back. When he realised Mr Goh was bleeding, Lim helped wipe blood off the older man's face. RUPTURE Mr Goh was taken in an ambulance to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital where he was found to have suffered several injuries, including a left eye globe rupture. He was later admitted for surgery. A medical report confirmed Mr Goh had lost sight in his eye and was unable to follow his ordinary routine for 20 days as a result. [[nid:479979]] Deputy Public Prosecutor Kang Jia Hui had sought $2,000 more in compensation than what was ordered by the court. She cited Mr Goh's trauma of suddenly losing sight in one eye, and the many inconveniences he had to endure, including surgery at his age, hospitalisation and multiple doctor's appointments. Pleading for a smaller amount, defence lawyer Josiah Zee said his client, who is single, earns $1,900 a month and has to support a 70-year-old mother and a 43-year-old brother who are both not working. Lim was sincerely apologetic to Mr Goh's family for the harm caused and has promised not to re-offend, the lawyer added. Out on bail of $10,000, Lim will start his sentence on April 6. He must pay the compensation by Friday or serve an additional five weeks in jail. For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned.

"Amanda Yeo Pei Min had told her lover Leong Wei Guo to loosen the wheel bolts of her husband's car and cut its brake wires.  SINGAPORE - A woman who plotted to kill her then husband has been sentenced to five months' jail. Administrative assistant Amanda Yeo Pei Min, 27, had conspired with her 25-year-old boyfriend - delivery assistant Leong Wei Guo - to sabotage her spouse's car so that he would be killed in a traffic accident. On Wednesday (March 11), Deputy Public Prosecutor Houston Johannus told District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt that Yeo had been ""fuelled by malice and rage"" towards her then husband - Mr Walter Ting, 28 - who worked as a private-hire car driver. In urging the judge to sentence her to five months' jail, the DPP stressed that she was the mastermind behind the plot. He also asked for a four-month jail term for Leong, adding that he had committed the offence due to a ""foolish sense of bravado"". Judge Chay agreed with the DPP and sentenced Leong to four months' jail. Leong and Yeo had each pleaded guilty on Feb 20 to working together and agreeing to cause grievous hurt to Mr Ting by performing a rash act. The Straits Times understands that they are no longer together. Yeo is also divorced from Mr Ting. Yeo married Mr Ting in September 2011, and they have two children. [[nid:478356]] But she later had an affair with Leong, which Mr Ting learnt about in June 2017. ""Walter wanted to divorce Amanda and they quarrelled frequently. Enraged by the acrimonious quarrels, she decided to kill Walter. ""She conspired with Leong to sabotage Walter's car so that he would get into an accident and die,"" DPP Johannus had said earlier. Yeo told her boyfriend Mr Ting's death would ""settle all her problems"" and Leong agreed to kill him. On Jan 6, 2018, Yeo told Leong to puncture Mr Ting's car tyres with some nails. In the wee hours the next day, Leong went to a multi-storey carpark near Mr Ting's flat in Yung Kuang Road, in Jurong. With Yeo's help, he found the car and used a pair of pliers to insert a nail into each of its left tyres. It is not clear if Mr Ting drove his car after this. Yeo later discovered that her husband had made plans for a road trip with their children and his parents on Jan 11, 2018. She instructed Leong to loosen the wheel bolts on Mr Ting's car, which would be parked near his parents' flat, and cut the brake wires. Once again, he agreed. In the wee hours of Jan 11, 2018, Leong went to a multi-storey carpark near a Housing Board block in Depot Road where Mr Ting's parents live, and tried but failed to loosen the wheel bolts. After that, he used a wire cutter to cut the anti-braking system wire behind the front right tyre and sent Yeo a picture of the damage. ""A complete cut of the (anti-braking system) wire will compromise the safety of the driver as the need to apply hard (or) emergency brake cannot be foreseen. ""The front right wheel of the motor car may lock, and this would pose a safety risk to the driver as he may lose control of the car,"" DPP Johannus said. Leong was spotted walking around suspiciously with a jacket draped over his head and the police were alerted. Officers arrived soon after and arrested him. For committing the offence, Leong and Yeo could have each been sentenced to up to a year's jail and a maximum fine of $2,500.

" When someone yells ""stop"", goes limp, taps out — the fight is over. For an elderly man in a coffee shop brawl, however, the sight of his bloodied victim knocked down to the ground wasn't enough. In a clip circulating on Facebook on Monday (Feb 3), he was seen attacking another senior in a coffee shop at Upper Cross Street as a crowd gathered near the commotion. The injured man was seen sitting on the ground as a y did so, the aggressor was seen snatching a beer bottle from a table before approaching the injured man. As he swung the bottle at the latter, he was stopped by passers-by. Although several people yelled at him to stop, the agitated man continued to charge at the man until he was pulled away by two women. He soon broke away from them and continued to grab the other man by his shirt and hit him. The attacker was later tackled by a male passer-by who tried to pin him down. But he managed to get back to his feet and picked up a plastic chair as a woman shouted for an ambulance to be called. Close to the end of the one-and-a-half minute video, a young man stepped up to the pair and separated them. While some netizens speculated that the seniors were fighting over a beer lady, the exact reason for the scuffle remains unknown. The police told AsiaOne that they were alerted to a dispute at Block 34 Upper Cross Street on Monday (Feb 3) evening. Two men aged 63 and 67 were taken to Singapore General Hospital, with the younger one subsequently arrested for rash act causing hurt and criminal force. Investigations are ongoing.

"Lorry driver Teo Seng Tiong was found guilty of causing hurt to cyclist Eric Cheung and failing to report the accident to the police within 24 hours.  SINGAPORE - A lorry driver who was seen in a viral video having an altercation with a cyclist was sentenced to seven weeks' jail and fined $500 on Tuesday (Jan 14). Teo Seng Tiong, 59, was also disqualified from driving for two years. His lawyer, Mr Chia Boon Teck, told the court that his client, a Singaporean, intended to appeal. Teo had earlier been convicted of causing hurt to cyclist Eric Cheung Hoyu as well as for failing to report an accident to the police within 24 hours. The video of the incident, which occurred at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Pasir Ris Rise just before noon on Dec 22, 2018, garnered more than three million views online. On Tuesday, the court heard that Teo had previous convictions for voluntarily causing hurt in 1988 and 2012, and was convicted for affray in 1999. He was also convicted for an obscene act in 1993 and insulting the modesty of a woman in 2007. He also had multiple traffic offences involving careless driving, speeding and beating a red light between 1999 and 2015. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong called for the court to sentence Teo to 10 weeks' jail and a fine of $500. The DPP also called for him to be disqualified from driving for three years. The defence pleaded with the court to impose a fine for both of Teo's charges. [[nid:471962]] In remarks during sentencing, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said he was unable to agree with the defence for a fine on the more serious charge of causing hurt by rash driving. He added that the sentence called by the prosecution also did not give ""sufficient consideration to the deliberate actions of the cyclist... in breaking the lorry side mirror in the incident"". But the judge also said that the reaction of the accused thereafter was ""disproportionate"". In the video, Mr Cheung is seen hitting the left side mirror of Teo's lorry. The lorry then suddenly swerved to the left towards Mr Cheung, who fell off his bicycle and onto the grass verge on the side of the road. Both Mr Cheung and Teo were later arrested within three days of the accident. Mr Cheung pleaded guilty to committing mischief and causing obstruction by riding his bicycle in the middle of the lane instead of the leftmost side, and was fined $2,800 on April 12 last year. Teo, who contested the two charges, was found guilty last month by Judge Chay, who found that the lorry driver had ""deliberately swerved"" his vehicle into the cyclist. The verdict came after a four-day trial, which saw several parties involved in the accident taking the stand, including Teo and Mr Cheung. During the trial, Teo testified that he was attempting to overtake two cyclists - one of whom was Mr Cheung - when he heard the sound of ""something breaking"". Thinking that he had hit a taxi on his right, Teo said he then reacted in the moment by swerving to his left, in the direction of Mr Cheung, a British national. Teo had also said that he was not unhappy that his side mirror had been broken as ""it only costs $15"". This was disputed by the second cyclist in the accident, Mr Nigel Harper, who told the court that Teo appeared upset and quite angry at Mr Cheung, and was pointing at the broken mirror repeatedly. For acting rashly to cause hurt, Teo could have been jailed up to a year and fined up to $5,000. For failing to report an accident to the police within 24 hours, he could have been jailed up to three years or fined up to $1,000 as a first offender.

"A screenshot of the video where the man is seen apparently elbowing the woman in the face.  A man who allegedly pestered two women at a bar in Prinsep Street last Friday, also allegedly elbowed one of them in the face after they rejected his advances, dislocating her jaw. The police told The New Paper yesterday that a 25-year-old man has been arrested for voluntarily causing hurt. The victim, who wanted to be known only as Ms Kylie, posted a clip of the alleged assault on Facebook on Saturday. In the video, a group of six men and women appear to be talking before the man apparently elbows the woman in the face. Ms Kylie, a Singapore permanent resident who is studying abroad, was here to visit friends and family for Christmas and the New Year. According to the Facebook post, the man had been bothering the victim and her friend, which made them uncomfortable. The post read: ""I told him politely to leave us alone and go away countless times. However he refused to budge and instead elbowed my face out of the blue and dislocated my jaw."" It also said the victim's friends and other witnesses of the alleged assault stayed by her side and protected her. Ms Kylie told TNP yesterday: ""In that moment, I felt very powerless and defenceless. ""From the moment I saw him at the bar, he kept coming over to me. ""It was unfortunate that this happened to me, but hopefully it (will) bring some light to the topic (of assault) so no other women or men will be in my shoes in the future."" The full-time student, who is also a freelance make-up artist, said she has been having trouble sleeping and eating because of the throbbing pain in her jaw. Reflecting on the incident, Ms Kylie said that being aware of these situations and learning how to handle them is important to deter assaults like this. Ms Anisha Joseph, head of care services at the Association of Women for Action and Research, told TNP: ""The onus should not be on women to protect themselves from random strangers assaulting them. ""The conversation here should be framed differently. The focus should not be on women finding ways to protect themselves, but on perpetrators stopping this dangerous and violent behaviour."". On how one should behave in a dispute, Ms Gloria James-Civetta, head lawyer at Gloria James-Civetta & Co, said: ""Adopt a non-provoking tone, but at the same time, do not relent to the aggressor's unreasonable request."" Citing past cases, she said the present case presents little challenge as there is footage of the incident and witnesses were around. But in cases where these are lacking, there would be just the complainant's testimony. In such instances, the testimonies would have to be unusually convincing. She noted that submission does not satisfy as consent. ""No means no. Maybe means no. Let me think about it means no,"" said Ms James-Civetta.

"A tourist from New Zealand assaulted her in their hotel room at the Marina Bay Sands.  Jealous that his girlfriend had danced with another man, a tourist from New Zealand assaulted her in their hotel room at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Taputoro Meihana Deane Delamere, 33, was yesterday jailed for three months and four weeks after he pleaded guilty to one charge each for a rash act endangering the safety of others, voluntarily causing hurt, and voluntarily hurting a police officer. Two other charges for hurting a police officer and mischief were taken into consideration. Taputoro arrived in Singapore on Nov 13 last year with his 29-year-old girlfriend, who is also from New Zealand. The couple, who had been dating for about nine months, went to a club on Nov 16 and the woman danced with another man, making Taputoro jealous and angry. When they returned to their hotel room on the seventh storey of MBS at about 4am, they quarrelled and he shouted at her. He then assaulted her and smashed her phone against the wall. Taputoro also used a chair to smash the glass panel at the balcony and tried to drag his girlfriend to the window. He wanted to force her to jump with him. The woman managed to flee from the room. At about 5.30am, he threw two suitcases, two backpacks and one metal pole from the room. The items landed on a road nearby and nobody was injured. At about 5.50am, the police were called to the scene and observed Taputoro from the balcony of an adjacent room, as he had locked himself in. When he saw the officers, he shouted at them and challenged them to come and get him. He then climbed over from the balcony via the parapet and approached the officers. As they tried to arrest him, he assaulted them, causing one of them to fall and hit the back of his head against a glass door. According to court documents, Taputoro's actions caused more than $8,700 in damage to the hotel room. He had damaged the room's main door, three glass balcony panels, several chairs, a coffee table and a sprinkler head, among other items. In mitigation, Taputoro apologised for his actions and said he had let his four children and partner down. His sentence was backdated to Nov 22 last year, when he was held in remand. For each count of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, he could have been jailed for up to seven years, and fined or caned.

" A single click of her tongue was all it took to start a brawl in the middle of a supermarket in Clementi Mall. Shoppers stumbled across an unusual scene on Saturday morning (Dec 21) after two women and a teen got into a fight. Apparently unhappy that a woman had tutted at him for blocking her way, the 14-year-old boy turned around to spew a string of Hokkien expletives at her, Lianhe Wanbao reported. His foul language and poor attitude also angered the woman's daughter who gave him a slap. Already agitated, the slap only served to further incense the boy, causing him to surge towards the pair and try to hit them. In an attempt at mediation, a middle-aged man who happened to pass by tried to step between both parties. Instead, the boy turned his attack towards him. Despite being shoved at over 10 times, the man continued to shield the women by repeatedly holding the teen back whenever he pushed forward, all whilst persuading him to stop. In one of the videos a witness shared with the newspaper, the boy nearly succeeded in breaking past the man, only to be pushed away by yet another male passer-by. Another clip showed the teen sitting on the floor with the man squatting next to him until the police arrived. Before the clip ended, a round of applause was heard, supposedly to thank the man for successfully defusing the situation. Police arrived on the scene soon after the altercation, a witness told the Chinese evening daily. The police said they were alerted to the incident at 9.29 am and they are looking into a case of causing hurt. The teenager has since been taken to the National University Hospital for treatment while investigations are ongoing.

" SINGAPORE - An Australian man allegedly involved in a condominium fatal killer litter case now faces an extra charge of causing hurt to a woman in the same incident, with the new offence described in court documents as being ""religiously aggravated"". Appearing in court via video-link, Andrew Gosling, 47, was charged on Thursday (Dec 5) with one count of causing hurt with an instrument, injuring a woman, identified as Ms Manisah, at a 35-storey condominium in Spottiswoode Park Road. Earlier this year, he was charged with one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with an instrument. Gosling had allegedly thrown a glass wine bottle from a lift landing on the seventh storey of the Spottiswoode 18 condominium towards a table near the barbecue area on the fifth storey at around 8.30pm on Aug 18. The bottle is said to have struck Ms Manisah, causing bruises to her right shoulder, and also hit delivery driver Nasiari Sunee's head, causing a skull fracture that led to his death. The 73-year-old driver was at a housewarming party of a relative when the bottle hit him just as he was about to eat. The eldest of his four children, service manager Nas Suriati Nasiari, told The Straits Times in an earlier interview that relatives heard two thuds before her father collapsed on the ground with a head wound. They then spotted an intact glass bottle nearby. A relative, who is a nurse, attended to Mr Nasiari before he was taken by an ambulance to the Singapore General Hospital. Madam Nas Suriati, 44, said that her father's heart stopped thrice during treatment and the family decided not to resuscitate him if it stopped a fourth time. ""We didn't want to prolong the pain,"" she said. Mr Nasiari's blood pressure plunged the next morning and he died at around 9am. The grandfather of nine was buried on Aug 20. Following the incident, police went door to door at Spottiswoode 18 to look for the person responsible. [[nid:459392]] Residents said that officers showed them a picture of an Italian wine bottle. They were also asked if they had been drinking wine and were willing to provide fingerprint samples. Gosling was subsequently arrested on Aug 28. Court documents did not state if he lives at the condominium. Gosling, who has worked in IT, is represented by lawyer Gloria James-Civetta. She told the court on Thursday that a private psychiatrist has concluded an assessment of Gosling and a report will be ready in a week's time. Gosling was not offered bail and his case has been adjourned to Jan 2 next year. Offenders convicted of causing grievous hurt with an instrument can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned.

" SINGAPORE - A Maserati driver whose car dragged a police officer for more than 100m along Bedok Reservoir Road in 2017 was convicted on Wednesday (Dec 4) of several offences, including voluntarily causing grievous hurt. After a five-day trial, District Judge Ng Peng Hong also found the driver, Lee Cheng Yan, guilty of nine other charges, including failing to stop after the accident and obstruction of justice. The 35-year-old Singaporean is also facing 59 other charges related to matters such as online gambling and illegal moneylending. These will be dealt with at a later date. During the trial, the court heard that Lee, who owned the Maserati, drove the car on Nov 17, 2017, despite being disqualified owing to earlier traffic offences. He also did not have the mandatory third-party risk insurance for the vehicle at the time of the incident. Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar Abd Kahar, 26, had stopped Lee's white Maserati in Bedok Reservoir Road at about 9.20pm as the older man was not using his seat belt. The policeman parked his motorcycle in front of the Maserati before dismounting. He then approached the car to speak to Lee, who wound down his window. Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh had earlier said: ""Instead of complying, the accused fled the scene by suddenly reversing the Maserati, before accelerating quickly forward while the victim was standing next to the driver-seat door."" [[nid:464098]] He added that Staff Sgt Khairulanwar's uniform got caught in the driver-side door of the Maserati. The car, which was moving at between 79kmh and 84kmh, dragged the policeman for more than 100 m before he fell onto the road. The Maserati then sped off, the court heard. Staff Sgt Khairulanwar was taken to hospital to be treated for pain over his right knee, neck and lower back. He was later given more than 20 days of medical leave. DPP Koh had said that after the accident, Lee abandoned the Maserati in Willow Avenue near Aljunied Road. Lee later phoned a friend, marketing executive Jeff Chan, telling him that he had been involved in an ""incident"" with the Traffic Police. Mr Chan testified in court in October that he tried to persuade Lee to surrender to the authorities. He also said that at around 11 pm, Lee asked if he could drive him home to Potong Pasir. But when they arrived there, they spotted patrol cars in the area. Mr Chan said: ""He didn't dare go home and asked to go back to my home again."" At Mr Chan's Kallang Bahru flat, Lee asked to borrow a T-shirt and he threw his own white T-shirt down the rubbish chute, the court heard. Police turned up at Mr Chan's home at around 2am on Nov 18, 2017. Officers arrested Lee, who was charged in court later that day. However, Lee testified during the trial that he was not the driver of the Maserati when the accident took place. Lee said that about two hours before the accident, he had given the car keys to a man known only as ""Kelvin"", whom he had known for about five months. He added that he lent the Maserati ""reluctantly"" to Kelvin, whom he did not know ""that well"". The court heard that neither Kelvin's surname nor address was given by Lee to the investigation officer handling the case. DPP Senthilkumaran Sabapathy then questioned the existence of Kelvin and told Lee: ""You are obviously lying."" Lee replied that he was telling the truth. He will be sentenced in January next year. If convicted of causing grievous hurt to the policeman, he can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned.

" After being told to stop shaking his leg in the cinema, the man attacked fellow moviegoers, raining blows on them. Yesterday, Clifton Wong Jun Han, 23, a fireman with Changi Airport Group, was jailed for one day and fined $3,000 for one charge of voluntarily causing hurt. A similar charge was taken into consideration. The court heard that around 5pm on Aug 1, Wong went to watch a movie with his pregnant wife at Shaw Cinema in The Seletar Mall. During the movie, he began to shake his leg, causing disturbance to another couple who felt their seats moving. The fellow moviegoer then told Wong to refrain from shaking his leg. The movie ended at about 5.50pm, and Wong got up from his seat to leave. But he claimed that as he was doing so, he tripped and stepped on the victim's foot. The victim did not respond, but while walking away, Wong turned around and uttered a profanity at him. The victim, who was still seated, chose to ignore him. But Wong confronted the man and started raining blows on his face. The victim's wife then tried to stop Wong, but he then turned on her and punched her arm several times. Wong had to be restrained by his own pregnant wife and other moviegoers. The injured couple went to Sengkang General Hospital, where the man was found to have suffered bruising on his head while the woman suffered bruising on her arm. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kevin Ho urged the court to jail Wong, saying there were aggravating factors including the attack on the woman who had tried to stop him. But defence lawyer Gino Hardial Singh asked the court for the maximum fine of $5,000 instead, saying his client had snapped as a result of considerable stress and withdrawal effects from not smoking. He added that the harm caused was low and he did not have any prior convictions. District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said he agreed with the prosecution that a custodial sentence was warranted, as Wong had attacked not only the victim, but the victim's wife as well. For each count of voluntarily causing hurt, Wong could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.

"Chen Xiaqin used a beer bottle to hit the victim on the head and tried to stab her with it after the bottle broke.  The wife of a company director smashed a beer bottle on a teenage employee whom she suspected of having an affair with her husband. Chen Xiaqin, 40, a Chinese national, was yesterday jailed for seven months after pleading guilty to one count of causing hurt with a dangerous weapon. In May last year, Chen, her husband, 42, and his employees gathered at a steamboat restaurant in Geylang to celebrate her birthday. During the dinner, Chen and her husband quarrelled, and he later left the restaurant. Around 7.30pm, Chen, who had drunk beer, approached an 18-year-old girl who worked in her husband's production company. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo told the court: ""She pulled the victim's hair twice and used a glass beer bottle to hit the back of the victim's head."" The bottle shattered and a struggle ensued between the two women. Chen tried to stab the girl with the broken bottle, but she blocked the blow and was cut on her forearm. The assault was captured by a closed-circuit television camera. The victim was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she got stitches on her scalp and was treated for the cut on her arm, which had exposed the underlying muscle. She still has scars from her wounds. The court heard that Chen and her husband have a three-year-old son, who is now in China. In her mitigation, Chen's lawyer, Mr Dhanwant Singh, said her husband was behaving suspiciously and his disappearance from the restaurant was abrupt. Before he left, he had made a sign indicating endearment to the girl, whom Chen suspected of having an affair with him. Mr Singh said the offence was not personal but an act to protect Chen's husband from being ""stolen"" and to keep the family together. He said: ""In all these circumstances, this is an exceptional case of a mother and wife's reaction for the first time in her life, which unfortunately is frowned upon by the law."" A Changi General Hospital medical report showed Chen was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and suicidal thoughts.

"Haidilao is known for many things — impeccable service, adorable robot staff, and most recently? A diner who clocked a fellow customer in the face with a bowl of sauce, all because he found the other's behaviour unsanitary. Jason Esais Gao Weijie, 34, was fined $4,000 after he pleaded guilty for voluntarily causing hurt to Eugene Lee Wei Liang, 33, in a court hearing on Thursday (Nov 14). The incident occurred in the early morning of Jan 12 when the victim had gone out with a group of friends for supper. According to Lianhe Zaobao, Lee was eating from a bowl while he waited in the queue at the condiment counter. When it got to his turn, he placed his used bowl onto the counter and picked up a sauce bowl to fill. Gao, who was standing behind him, witnessed the entire scene. He felt that Lee's actions were unhygienic and immediately demanded that he removed his used bowl immediately. Lee waved him off and said he would take it away once he was done filling his sauce bowl. This angered Gao, who flew into a rage and began arguing with him. Once he was done, Lee grabbed his bowls and turned to leave. However, Gao was still fuming and immediately grabbed at his neck from behind before decking him in the face with his own bowl of sauce. Onlookers had to physically pull him off in order to separate the two. The entire ordeal was captured on the restaurant's CCTV and the footage was reviewed in court this morning. Gao has paid $8,000 in compensation to the victim, who spent $2,420.71 on necessary recuperation fees. His lawyer pointed out how he had made compensation at a ""very early stage"" and the amount was ""way above"" the fees incurred by the victim. Additionally, he did not have a history of violent behaviour and showed remorse before he was charged, and therefore urged the court to impose a lighter punishment on Gao, who could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for causing hurt.

"One man's catty behaviour has caught the attention of the internet. A cat lover in Sembawang Crescent was in the midst of feeding a stray cat on Sunday (Nov 10) around midnight when a man claiming to be a police officer came up to her and slapped her. In an interview with Shin Min Daily News, the 43-year-old housewife recounted how she had been minding her own business when an Indian man in a white shirt and dark r and told her that she wasn't allowed to feed the cats, citing several resident complaints and alleged police reports. However, he failed to produce a warrant card, rousing the suspicion of the cat feeder. When she threatened to report him to the police, he flew into a rage and smacked her across the face. He slapped her so hard that her glasses flew off her face, she said. The shock left the woman frozen on the spot as he turned tail and fled towards his car, but not before grabbing her phone and throwing it aside. She filed a police report afterwards. Ever since she started feeding the cats in February this year, she has yet to receive a single complaint, the woman said. According to other residents, the feeder would come by to feed the cats every Sunday. She had always made sure to clean up after every session, going so far as to wash the ground before leaving. In light of the attack, another cat feeder identified as Nasha told reporters how she had faced residents throwing insults and even slippers at her. ""Apparently (the residents) just don't like seeing stray cats in their area, let alone seeing someone feed them."" The police said they are investigating the incident. They also reminded the public to remain vigilant and be aware of similar frauds impersonating them.

"Ever since the ban of e-scooters on footpaths kicked in on Tuesday (Nov 5), there has been some confusion on the new regulations. A GrabFood cyclist was unceremoniously shoved off his ride by an angry pedestrian despite travelling on the bicycle path on Wednesday night (Nov 6). The 41-year-old man suffered injuries to his neck, right shoulder, left hand and both legs as a result of the fall. In an interview with Shin Min Daily News, his wife revealed that doctors had warned them of a possible neck fracture. Although they abided by the rules and kept to bicycle paths, she was frustrated that they were still met with such hostility. The pair had set off from Northpoint City to make a delivery — him on a bicycle and his wife on a power-assisted bicycle, he recounted. As his wife was not familiar with the destination, he decided to accompany her. When they turned onto a cycling path along Yishun Ave 11, they saw a couple walking towards them. The riders rang their bells for a few minutes to alert the pedestrians, but the couple still refused to give way to them. Whilst trying to cycle past the pedestrians, the man violently shoved at the rider's food delivery bag, causing him to lose balance and fall onto the grass. He also stopped him from getting up and pushed him again. ""He even yelled: 'You how can cycle here?! Earn what rice bowl?! (sic),'"" the rider recounted. His wife immediately called the police, who arrived on the scene shortly after. The rider and his wife used to be a waiter and hotel receptionist respectively. In order to support their two children, aged four and six, the pair switched jobs to become food delivery riders. In the face of his injury, on top of their family circumstances, the rider's wife said she felt anxious about their plans for the future. The hospital might have given him three days of medical leave, but his neck continues to cause him pain and requires further examination.

" It's been two days since the e-scooters ban on footpaths came into effect, but considering how suddenly it was announced, there's still a fair bit of confusion regarding what exactly is or isn't allowed on certain paths. But there shouldn't be any doubt that bicycles have the right to use cycling paths. Unfortunately, two pedestrians didn't seem to think so and pushed a GrabFood cyclist off his ride. The incidentacebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2211512458955137&set=a.913733992066330&type=3&theater[/embed] Ken Cheong, a passerby who witnessed the incident, described in his Facebook post how the cyclist had ""sounded his horn"" to alert the two pedestrians walking in front of him before he politely asked them to allow him to pass. Instead of moving aside, however, they allegedly behaved in an ""impulsive gangster manner"" and threatened the cyclist, Cheong wrote. [embed]https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2441573489273851&set=a.172674352830454&type=3&theater[/embed] According to another passerby, Liew Yong Liang, the male pedestrian pushed the cyclist, yelling: ""You how can ride here?! (sic)"" The police arrived on the scene afterwards, though it is unknown who reported the incident. The pedestrians were told to go home and wait for the results of the police investigation while the cyclist was taken to the hospital, Liew added. His post gathered over 2,300 shares within 16 hours and saw many furious netizens slamming the pedestrians in the comment section. The police told AsiaOne that they were alerted on Nov 6 night to a case of voluntarily causing hurt involving two pedestrians and a cyclist along the bicycle path near Blk 348C Yishun Avenue 11. ""The cyclist, a 41-year-old man, was conveyed conscious to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Police investigations are ongoing,"" they added. Beyond incensed pedestrians, the ban has also caused plenty of worry for food delivery riders who depend on e-scooters to carry out their jobs. Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam spoke with roughly 30 riders on Tuesday evening (Nov 5) and said he will arrange for another meeting soon in hopes of finding an agreeable arrangement.

" A doctor is on trial for allegedly beating up his then-girlfriend in his bedroom after she refused to have sex with him. Clarence Teo Shun Jie, 35, had allegedly assaulted Ms Rachel Lim En Hui, 27, so violently that she suffered multiple facial fractures. Police officers had to break down his door to rescue her. Teo, who works as a locum, is claiming trial to causing grievous hurt to Ms Lim and wrongfully confining her in his bedroom on Aug 27, 2017. On the first day of the trial yesterday at the State Courts, Deputy Public Prosecutors April Phang and Amanda Sum read their opening statement where they said Teo's father had called the police at around 4am that day. He said there was a dispute in his home in Redhill Close. Teo and Ms Lim had met over the dating application, Coffee Meets Bagel, in early 2017. Ms Lim, who took the stand yesterday, said they started dating immediately. She then found out that he was an alcohol abuser. She claimed Teo would get angry when he asked her about her past relationships. In a police report read out in court, Teo had allegedly punched Ms Lim in March 2017. They were in his flat when he suddenly brought up her past relationships and he punched her multiple times, but he apologised to her the next day. [[nid:466633]] Ms Lim, who works in the communications industry, told the court that she had forgiven him because Teo apologised and said he would change. But weeks later, he poured cold apple juice on her and turned on the air-conditioner and caused her to shiver. She added that they had sex before, in his car, and Teo would be the one who asked for sex. Ms Lim said the night before the incident, they had gone drinking at three places. They then returned to his flat at about 2am in good spirits. But he allegedly became enraged and aggressive when she was reluctant to have sex with him, said the DPPs. They wrote: ""When she tried to leave the room to escape from him, he pursued her, forced her back into the room, and locked the door."" They added that Teo had allegedly punched the victim's face repeatedly with great force and hit her head against the wall. When police officers arrived at the unit, they heard screams and shouts coming from Teo's locked room. [[nid:466438]] One of them, Staff Sergeant Muhammad Jauhary Sabiri, said in court yesterday that Teo's father and sister were in the flat when the police arrived. They had urged Teo to open the door, but he did not do so. The officers had also called out to Ms Lim, who said she was injured and could not get out. One of the officers later kicked open the door to find Teo lying face down on the bed in his boxer shorts and arrested him. Staff Sergeant Muhammad Jauhary said Ms Lim was sitting on the floor in the corner of the room with her face badly bruised beyond recognition. The trial resumes today.

"One of the victims of an attack at Marina Bay Sands on Halloween sustained broken bones in both legs. SINGAPORE - A night of Halloween fun at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) turned to real horror when three partygoers were badly injured by an attacker allegedly wielding a sword in its carpark last Sunday (Oct 27). The three male victims sustained serious injuries including broken bones and deep cuts. One man's ear was almost severed in the brutal pre-dawn slashing. One of the three, who gave his name only as Eugene, told The Straits Times on Saturday that their group of eight had been heading home at around 6am after a Halloween-themed party at nightclub Marquee when they were accosted. While in the basement carpark of the integrated resort, a man dressed in a doctor's coat allegedly charged at him, said Eugene, 25. ""At first I thought it was one of those Halloween jump scare kind of things,"" he said, describing the blade as resembling a short sword. The sword was swung so hard, Eugene sustained broken bones in both legs. One of his companions, who gave his name as Wei, 34, said that he stepped in to defend his friend and was also slashed. [[nid:466645]] He showed ST gashes on his forehead, chin and ear, part of which had been left dangling and had to be stitched back together. Eugene, a manager, said of his friend: ""He was lying in a pool of blood, face turned purple... thankfully one of my friends is a nurse, and she managed to stem the bleeding."" Another friend who was filming the incident on his phone was beaten by another attacker and sustained bruises and a sprain, he said. The police confirmed the incident, saying it responded to an incident at 1 Bayfront Avenue at about 6.15am on Oct 27. In the statement, police said three male victims, aged between 25 and 34, were conveyed conscious to Singapore General Hospital. Police subsequently identified and arrested three men, aged between 22 and 24, in connection with the case. They were charged last Wednesday (Oct 30) for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon with common intention, which carries a sentence of up to seven years' imprisonment as well as a possible fine and caning. The trio are in remand and due to appear in court on Nov 6. Eugene, who had screws inserted in his left leg to join the broken bones, was discharged from the hospital on Friday. Doctors say it will be at least a year before he will be able to walk again. Eugene and Wei said that they were disappointed with how MBS handled the matter, both during the incident and in the days after. A security guard arrived on scene only about 30 minutes after the incident, after being alerted by a friend of the victims who had gone looking for help, Eugene claimed. [[nid:464062]] While the police and ambulance arrived within 10 minutes of being called, there was a slight delay in locating them within the carpark. ""If security knew this was happening under their noses, they would have been able to direct them to us,"" he said. Eugene added that he had contacted MBS on Thursday to ask what was being done about the incident and a customer service officer referred him to the police. Replying to queries, an MBS spokesman said it was alerted to the incident at 6.20am on Oct 27 and responded immediately. ""We take a serious view of this case and are working closely with the Police in its ongoing investigations,"" she said.

" SINGAPORE - An off-duty full-time national serviceman (NSF) with the Singapore Police Force attacked a police officer after a night of merrymaking and, among other things, used his hands to choke the latter. Assistant training instructor at the Special Operations Command Mohammad Jeffry Lui Azman, 21, pleaded guilty in court on Friday (Nov 1) to causing hurt to Staff Sergeant Kenneth Ong Thiam Jun, 31. Around 1am on Jan 1 this year, Jeffry and two friends went to a nightspot called Club Nexus at the Oriental Plaza shopping centre in New Bridge Road where they shared three ""towers"" of beer and a bottle of liquor. The trio left the club at around 3.30am and were near the entrance of the mall when Jeffry approached another group of men and started mumbling incoherently. The court heard that he suddenly became agitated and raised his right fist, causing one of his friends to rush forward and pull him away. His other friend apologised to the group and told them that Jeffry was drunk. [[nid:460982]] A group of police officers including Staff Sgt Ong later arrived at the scene due to the commotion. Two of the officers were interviewing Jeffry and his friends when the NSF suddenly hurled an expletive at Staff Sgt Ong before challenging the older man to a fight. Jeffry later shoved Staff Sgt Ong's shoulder and grabbed the latter's elbows. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng said: ""A struggle between the accused and complainant ensued, as the complainant tried to break free from the accused, who was holding onto the complainant's elbows. ""In the midst of the struggle, both the accused and complainant lost their balance and fell onto the ground. The complainant landed on his back, with the accused falling on top of the complainant."" Jeffry then placed his hands on Staff Sgt Ong's neck and choked him for about five seconds. The other police officers in the vicinity stepped in and the NSF was arrested. Staff Sgt Ong went to the Singapore General Hospital where he was found with injuries, including multiple marks on his neck and an abrasion on his left shoulder. He was given two days of medical leave. On Friday, District Judge Ong Chin Rhu called for a report to assess Jeffry's suitability for probation. The NSF is now out on bail of $5,000 and will be sentenced on Nov 26. Offenders convicted of assaulting a public servant can be jailed for up to seven years and fined or caned.

Yesterday, Tusheta pleaded guilty to voluntarily causing hurt to Logeswari by a dangerous weapon. Two other charges for dishonest misappropriation of property and carrying an offensive weapon in public were taken into consideration.

Tusheta was also crossing the bridge with two friends. Drinking from a bottle of green tea, Tusheta splashed Logeswari with her drink as she passed her. The pair did not know each other.

"The court heard that Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar Abd Kahar (right) had stopped the Maserati in Bedok Reservoir Road as Lee Cheng Yan (left) was not using his seat belt.  SINGAPORE - The man accused of driving a Maserati that was caught on video dragging a Traffic Police (TP) officer along Bedok Reservoir Road has denied that he was the driver that day. Lee Cheng Yan, 35, is claiming trial to 10 charges related to s hurt to the police officer, failing to stop after an accident and obstruction of justice. Lee, who owned the car at the time, is also facing 59 other charges related to matters such as online gambling and illegal moneylending. These charges will be dealt with at a later date. In his opening address on Thursday (Oct 3), Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh said Lee drove the car despite being disqualified due to earlier traffic offences. He also did not have the mandatory third-party risk insurance for the car at the time of the incident. The court heard that Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar Abd Kahar, 26, had stopped the white Maserati in Bedok Reservoir Road at about 9.20pm as Lee was not using his seat belt. DPP Koh said: “The victim parked his motorcycle in front of the Maserati before dismounting. The victim then approached the driver’s window to speak to the accused. The accused wound down his window. “However, instead of complying, the accused fled the scene by suddenly reversing the Maserati before accelerating quickly forward while the victim was standing next to the driver-seat door.” [[nid:403332]] He added that Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar’s uniform got caught in the driver-side door of the Maserati. The car, which was moving at between 79 and 84km, then dragged the policeman for more than 100 metres before he fell onto the road. The Maserati then sped off, the court heard. Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar was taken to hospital to be treated for pain over his right knee, neck and lower back. He was later given more than 20 days of medical leave. The officer has been medically downgraded by the Home Team Medical Board due to his injuries. Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar, who took the stand on Thursday, told District Judge Ng Peng Hong that he still feels pain on his lower back when he carries heavy objects. He added that the injuries have affected his career and his promotion prospects. However, the policeman testified that he could not identify the driver of the Maserati as “everything happened so fast”. Technician Tay Boon Chong, who also took the stand on Thursday, told Judge Ng that he was in a nearby van with two other people when the incident took place. Mr Tay’s age was not mentioned in court. Two video clips taken from cameras in the van show Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar being dragged along the road before falling. One of the clips shows the officer lying on the road with passers-by rushing over to help him. But when cross-examined by one of Lee’s lawyers, Mr S. Balamurugan, Mr Tay told the court that he could not identify Lee, who was seated in the dock, as the driver. DPP Koh said that after the accident, Lee abandoned the Maserati in Willow Avenue near Aljunied Road. He added that Lee then went to a friend’s home and told the man that he “ran away from the Traffic Police”. The court heard that Lee spoke to another friend over the phone soon after and made a similar confession. He is now out on bail of $60,000 and his trial will resume on Friday. If convicted of causing grievous hurt to the policeman, he can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned.

" Claiming to be the headman of a gang, he called the police emergency hotline 24 times over five days, hurling vulgarities and abuse at the officers. Ng Chong Guan, 30, dared them to catch him and threatened to shoot them with a gun. Later, he also intimidated a cabby over the phone, threatened a coffee shop worker with a penknife and assaulted a stranger after his girlfriend claimed the woman's baby stroller hit her. Last Wednesday, Ng was jailed for 15 months and given an enhanced two-day jail term as he committed some offences while out of prison on a remission order. [[nid:406570]] He pleaded guilty to 10 charges, including abusing public servants, voluntarily causing hurt, criminal intimidation, theft and mischief. Another 22 charges were also taken into consideration.

Previously jailed for threatening to bomb a clinic in 2015 and the home of a woman who refused to be his girlfriend in 2016, Ng has a litany of past offences. He was near the end of a remission order when he made the first call on Sept 23 last year. At about 9.50am, Ng dialled 999, uttered a vulgarity and told the operator he was a ""gangster headman"", a ""loan shark syndicate"" and asked him to ""come Geylang see me"". The operator dispatched police resources to Geylang but could not locate Ng. [[nid:388054]] He was nabbed on Sept 27 after he again made a foul-mouthed call to the police, who were able to trace and arrest him that day. Ng admitted that he made the call, claiming he was stressed. In his submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Eric Hu said Ng was clearly recalcitrant. He wrote: ""Deterrence must also feature as the dominant sentencing principle to guard against abuse of an emergency hotline."" Ng had also attacked a 37-year-old woman on Nov 28 last year in Sembawang. The woman was pushing her baby in a stroller, going past him and his girlfriend, who were standing in the middle of the pathway at the void deck of Block 504B in Montreal Drive. When his girlfriend claimed the stroller hit her leg, Ng got angry and chased after the woman, pushing, slapping and kicking her multiple times. He also pulled the victim's hair and slammed her head against the wall. For threatening, abusing or insulting a public servant, he could have been fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for up to a year. For voluntarily causing hurt, he could have been jailed for two years and/or fined $5,000. ",https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/man-jailed-vulgar-calls-999,Asia One,,,
"Chen Guangze lost control of his car at Sentosa Gateway last year.  A lapse in his attention caused nine people to be injured, but his lawyer asked that he be spared a jail term as it would be ""highly crushing"" if he had a criminal record. The lawyer added that Chen Guangze, 39, the assistant vice-president of engineering at Shangri-la, had been stressed by preparations for the Trump-Kim Summit when he lost control of his car at Sentosa Gateway last year. Yesterday, Chen, a Singaporean, pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous hurt by negligent act. The court heard that on June 15 last year at about 3.40pm, Chen was driving along Sentosa Gateway with three colleagues in his car when he suddenly lost control, colliding with a minibus and another car in oncoming traffic. [[nid:434998]] Footage of the accident played in court yesterday showed Chen's car drifting across the lanes at a bend, straddling the double white lines before mounting the centre divider. But the car did not stop there, and continued moving into oncoming traffic, where it crashed into a minibus and another car. His three passengers and the five people in the minibus were injured in the crash. The two people in the other car were not taken to hospital. The court was told that visibility was clear and the road was dry at the time. Chen's car was damaged beyond repair, but he was still able to extricate himself without assistance. Paramedics who arrived at the scene assessed him to be alert, and he told them he had not fainted before the collision. Chen, along with eight of the victims, were taken to hospital. The medical report from the National University Hospital said Chen suffered a fracture on his left jaw and was discharged two days after the accident. [[nid:458326]] Three of the victims had to undergo surgery, including one of his colleagues who suffered fractures on five ribs. Deputy Public Prosecutor Daphne Lim asked the court to impose a jail term of at least six weeks and for Chen to be disqualified from driving for three years. But Chen's lawyer Wilson Foo said a prison sentence would be ""highly crushing"" as it would come with a criminal record. Mr Foo claimed his client was a family-oriented man who loved giving back to the community, and that he was facing great stress from being heavily involved in preparations for the Trump-Kim Summit that took place on June 12 last year. He added that Chen had been feeling especially frustrated at the time, having just gone for lunch at what he thought was a food tasting invitation but turned out to be ""actually just visiting friends for Hari Raya celebrations"". ""My client lost control suddenly, and inexplicably, in a momentary lapse of attention,"" said Mr Foo. ""He expresses remorse for the pain and suffering of the victims."" [[nid:439136]] Mr Foo also asked the court to consider a community-based sentence which would not come with a criminal record. But DPP Lim said that such a sentence was not supported by any precedent. District Judge Siva Shanmugam adjourned sentencing to Sept 3. For causing grievous hurt by negligent act, Chen could be jailed up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both. He is currently out on bail for $5,000.

When he later walked past a 19-year-old woman at about midnight on Nov 26 last year, he tried to shave her chin, causing a cut of about 1cm. The woman sought medical treatment at Changi General Hospital two days later. Clement Sng Tze Min, 39, was yesterday convicted of five charges of mischief and two charges of voluntarily causing hurt. The court heard that on several occasions in 2017, Sng removed five PIN (personal identification number) guards from HSBC automated teller machines (ATMs) at Suntec City and Tampines 1, disposing of them later in the vicinity. The PIN guards from the ATMs at Suntec City were valued at $85 each. They were not recovered. Sng offered to make restitution to HSBC but the bank declined.

The DPP said: ""At the same time, the accused decided to flee from the scene and started his e-scooter... Soh then tried to stop the accused by holding onto the handle of his e- scooter."" Chin ignored Ms Soh and had ridden away by the time police arrived at the scene around 7.45am. Mr Cheong's daughter later created a Facebook post about the incident to find more information about Chin from netizens. DPP Ong said that, based on Chin's distinctive attire - he was then wearing a helmet and a ski mask - he was identified, and his particulars given to Mr Cheong's daughter. She then passed them on to the police. Chin surrendered himself to the police around 10.30pm that day. The court heard Mr Cheong was treated at the National University Hospital and was found with superficial wounds on his right elbow. Ms Soh did not seek any medical help. Chin is now out on bail of $10,000 and was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on July 26 to begin his jail term. For each count of causing hurt by behaving in a rash manner, Chin could have been jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000.

" SINGAPORE - A woman abused her 23-month-old son so severely that he ended up with cerebral palsy and the developmental age of a six-month-old child. He also had to be fed through a tube inserted into the stomach. The court heard that in March last year, the woman slapped the boy, then 23 months old, so hard that he fell and hit his head on a metal table leg. This caused him to suffer severe head injuries. On another occasion, she fractured his arm by yanking it forcefully when he refused to take a bath. She also punched him more than five times in the chest when he did not listen to her instructions. The 27-year-old woman was sentenced on Monday (July 8) to 6½ years' jail after pleading guilty in May to two counts of causing grievous hurt to the boy and one count of ill-treating him. She cannot be named to protect the toddler's identity. He is the second of her three sons aged between one month old and four years at the time of the incident last March. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua said the woman often lost her temper with the victim. The children's father did not live with them. On March 25 last year, the mother was bathing her other two children at home when she found the toddler digging into his nappy and playing with the faeces. She became angry and slapped him hard on the right cheek, the DPP said. When the boy did not stop, the woman slapped him hard on the other cheek. ""The force of the accused's slap was so great that the victim's body turned midway and the victim fell sideways, with his head hitting hard against one of the legs of a nearby metal table,"" said DPP Chua. The boy cried and his body started to shake violently as his mother tried to calm him down. She massaged him with some oil, but he became barely responsive and was semi-conscious. Instead of an ambulance, the woman called a friend for help as she was afraid that her sons would be taken away from her. But at her friend's urging, she called an ambulance about 15 minutes later. Several months later, the boy was found to have cerebral palsy. As the injuries left him unable to be fed orally, he had to undergo gastrostomy, a surgical procedure to create an artificial external opening into the stomach for nutritional support. For each charge of causing grievous hurt, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. Women are not caned.

"Tang Lei and her sister Tang Bei outside the court on Aug 28, 2018. SINGAPORE - A pair of twin sisters who were fined for assaulting staff of Simei Green condominium lost their appeals against their conviction on Wednesday (July 3), after making emotionally-charged arguments for close to four hours. Chinese nationals Tang Bei and Tang Lei, 51, claimed that they had been provoked into committing the offences. They also claimed that they were the real victims and were being treated unfairly because of their nationality. But High Court judge Aedit Abdullah stressed that the courts in Singapore determine matters equally for all offenders, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity or religion. What the courts seek to do is consider the law and the evidence, and in the current case, there was no grave and sudden provocation that would clear the sisters of the charges, he said. As for the sisters' grievances that others involved in the incident were not prosecuted, the judge said the court can only deal with the charges before it. Last year, Tang Bei was fined $2,100 and Tang Lei $2,500 by a district judge after a 20-day trial. The incident, which took place at 11.40am on April 28, 2015, was caught on video, and widely shared. Tang Bei was convicted of causing hurting to and spitting on condominium manager Colvin Quek Choon Kiat, as well as causing hurt to security officer Charles Kenneth Bligh. Her sister was convicted of four charges: causing hurt to Mr Quek as well as spitting at and splashing a drink on him, and causing hurt to Mr Bligh. In February 2015, Mr Quek spoke to Tang Bei as she was accused of tailgating others out of the side gate of the property, but she told him that it was none of his business. Not long after, on Feb 25, 2015, she went to the management office to fill an application for a condominium access card. Mr Quek requested certain documents that were needed, but she turned aggressive and left without providing them. She returned with Tang Lei weeks later on April 28 but refused to be served by Mr Quek. Mr Quek then decided he should record a video of the meeting with his mobile phone, which he placed on a cabinet. The confrontation soon turned ugly, with Tang Bei berating him, and the two sisters raining blows on him. They also spat in his face and Tang Lei splashed the contents of her canned drink on him. The women also assaulted Mr Bligh when he stepped into the office. Mr Quek was treated for bruises and abrasions on his forehead. On Wednesday, Tang Lei argued that the video could not prove that there was contact as it was taken from one angle and there could be optical illusions. Tang Bei claimed that Mr Quek was the real ""provoker"" who had made verbal taunts at her before the video recording started. She alleged that he had molested her at their earlier meeting and she was merely exercising her ""basic right to react"". She added that Mr Quek was using the ""incomplete"" video to portray her as an unreasonable woman so that no one would believe her if she made a police report against him for molestation.

" He attacked his father with a steak knife over money, leaving the older man with multiple stab and slash wounds. Yesterday, Dylan Loy Zhong Huan, 19, was sentenced to reformative training for at least six months. In November 2016, the then Republic Polytechnic student asked his father for $3,000, claiming to need it for Uber rides as part of his work to survey Uber drivers on behalf of Grab. But his father, Mr Loy Shiang Chian, 49, gave him only $1,000. Loy spent the money and repeatedly asked for the remainder, which Mr Loy refused to give. At that time, the teenager was living with his grandparents and continues to do so. The reason for this was not revealed in court documents. At about 8.30am on Nov 29, 2016, Loy took a steak knife with an 8cm blade to his father's home to confront him. When his father told him he would not be giving him any more money, Loy attacked the older man, stabbing the back of his head continuously. Even when his father fell and screamed for help, the teenager continued to stab and slash him, and also punched and kicked him. The neighbours called the police when they saw the older man struggling on the ground with his son. Paramedics found the father on the floor near a pool of blood and also saw his son looking distressed and walking around the corridor. Mr Loy was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and discharged two days later with 20 days' hospitalisation leave. His medical report said his injuries would leave scars and those on his right forehead may cause some disfigurement. Loy pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt to his father with the weapon on Feb 27. District Judge May Mesenas had called for reports to assess the teenager's suitability for probation and reformative training. CHANGED PERSON Yesterday, his lawyer, Mr Deya Shankar Dubey, said Loy is a changed person since three years ago, having worked at controlling his emotions and actions. The lawyer said: ""He has changed for the better... he has grown, he has learnt the lesson."" But Judge Mesenas noted in the almost three years since the attack, he had not apologised to his family. She said: ""At the end of the day, I just hope that for you and your immediate family, there will be some kind of closure. I'm hopeful that over time, you will do your part."" For causing grievous hurt with a weapon, offenders can be jailed up to 15 years and fined or caned.

Having consumed beer and liquor, Chinese national Zhao Dong, 41, declined to drink any more when one of his housemates took out a bottle of white wine. But Li Yubao, 31, insisted Mr Zhao drink and the men got into a scuffle. Li, who is also a Chinese national, grabbed a knife from the kitchen and slashed Mr Zhao's left arm, which the latter had used to shield his face. [[nid:442171]] DEEP WOUND The resulting wound was so deep, it exposed tendons underneath and one of Mr Zhao's muscles was 50 per cent cut according to the medical report. Li was yesterday jailed 10 months over the slashing incident, which happened at about 10pm on Jan 29. According to court documents, Li, then a machine operator, and Mr Zhao, then a driver, lived with several others in a flat in western Singapore. They had been housemates for about a month. After the slashing, the pair stopped fighting and Mr Zhao went to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital with another housemate while Li stayed behind to clean up. Mr Zhao had to undergo surgery and was given 12 days' hospitalisation leave. [[nid:446963]] He initially did not make a police report as he did not want to jeopardise Li's career here.

"Lim Hong Liang (left) was sentenced to six years' jail, while Ong Hock Chye (right) was sentenced to 5½ years' jail and six strokes of the cane for the attack on Ms Audrey Chen Ying Fang's lover.  SINGAPORE - Unhappy that his mistress of almost two years had taken another lover, a married businessman ordered his rival to be attacked, leaving the victim with a scar that is likely to be permanent. For ordering the attack, Lim Hong Liang, 55, was sentenced on Tuesday (May 21) to six years' jail. Following a 10-day trial, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt convicted him on April 2 of taking part in a seven-person conspiracy to cause grievous hurt to banquet waiter Joshua Koh Kian Yong, 35. The judge also found a middleman linked to the attack - mover Ong Hock Chye, 48 - guilty of a similar offence. He was sentenced to 5½ years' jail and six strokes of the cane. Lim, a married man with three children, was smitten with Ms Audrey Chen Ying Fang, 27, after they met in 2014. She won the Miss Mermaid beauty pageant two years later. He gave her a job at SNL Logistics, the Singapore-based firm he owns, as an administrative executive, for which she was paid about $2,000 a month. However, the court heard that she did not have to turn up for work. Lim lavished gifts on her. A white Mercedes-Benz he gave her carried the plate 1991, her birth year. She also used his credit cards to pay for her expenses. He also allowed her to live rent-free in a unit he owned at The Parc condominium in West Coast Walk, renovating it to her preferred Hello Kitty theme. Banquet waiter Joshua Koh Kian Yong (above) was attacked under the orders of Lim Hong Liang.Photo: The Straits Times In their submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Wen Hsien and Stephanie Koh said: ""In return, Lim expected her to be faithful to him, and not to 'fool around outside'"". But in March 2016, Ms Chen started dating Mr Koh and announced their relationship on social media, which Lim later found out about. On April 8, Lim's older son, whose name was not stated in court documents, as well as his nephew, Ron Lim De Mai, 26, turned up at the condominium. Ron Lim rained blows on Mr Koh, fracturing his nose. According to court documents, Lim wanted his nephew to ""teach Joshua a lesson"" and it was Ron Lim who later roped in Ong to recruit others to carry out the task. Lim paid $5,000 to the hitmen to scar Mr Koh. On April 30, 2016, Ms Chen and Mr Koh were having supper at Huay Kwang Thai Kitchen in Townshend Road near Little India when he was ambushed by a group of men. [[nid:442423]] He was punched in the head and, as he tried to run, was slashed with a penknife on his arm and face. Ms Chen told the court that she saw a gaping wound on Mr Koh's mouth. The scar it has left behind is likely to be permanent. The slasher - Nur Muhammad Irwan Mohd Ngat, 30 - and the others involved in the attack have been dealt with in court. They included former technician Mohammad Amin Aman, 47; Juhari Ab Karim, 34; and Ron Lim. They were each sentenced to between 15 months and 14½ years' jail. Of these four men, only Juhari, who had punched Mr Koh but did not slash him, was spared the cane. Irwan's fiancee at the time, Nur Atika Fauziana Sherhan, 22, was also linked to the attack, and was sentenced to reformative training. On Tuesday, the court heard that Lim and Ong intend to appeal against the ruling. Lim was offered bail of $10,000 while Ong's bail was set at $30,000. Offenders convicted of causing grievous hurt with a weapon can be jailed for life or jailed for up to 15 years with a fine or caning. Lim cannot be caned, as he is over 50 years old.

" A girl and her friends walloped her boyfriend when they found out that he had taken photos of her sleeping in a sports bra and panties. The group also discovered that he took photos of another girl's buttocks when she was sleeping in short pants. Yesterday, the court called for a probation report for the girl, who is now 16. Those involved in the case cannot be named due to their ages. The court heard that on Aug 4 last year, the girl, who was 15 then, went for lunch with her boyfriend, then 17, at a coffee shop at Block 263 Compassvale Street. At about 5pm, the couple met the girl's friends at a nearby void deck. The group of friends was made up of three other girls then aged 15 to 16, four boys aged 17 to 19, and a 25-year-old man. At about 6pm, they checked the boyfriend's phone and discovered several photos of another girl when she was sleeping in short pants. She was the girlfriend of one of the boys in the group. They also found several photos of the accused taken when she was sleeping in her sports bra and underwear. Enraged, she kicked him in the groin and slapped him four times.

" SINGAPORE - A paralegal was so angry that her Indonesian domestic helper gave her mother pills which had spilled onto the floor that she repeatedly struck her with a wooden scratcher, causing injuries including two fractured fingers. Ng Bee Choo, 48, admitted causing grievous hurt to Ms Weti Alimi Carmadi and was jailed for 10 months on Monday (April 29). Ms Weti, 33, started working at Ng's Circuit Road flat in October 2016 and her duties included taking care of her employer's aged, wheelchair-bound mother who has heart problems. The court heard that Ng started abusing her maid physically and verbally the following year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Houston Johannus told District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt that Ms Weti did not seek help or tell anyone about her ordeal, as she was frightened. In late January last year, Ng was waiting for Ms Weti to give her mother her daily medication at around 7.30am when she noticed that the maid had dropped a bottle of pills onto the floor, and its contents spilled out. Ms Weti then picked up the pills from the floor and fed them to the elderly woman. The DPP said: ""The accused was furious with the victim, as she perceived that the victim had fed her mother with dirtied pills, and used a wooden scratcher to strike the victim's head once. [[nid:441646]] ""The victim felt pain by the impact of the wooden scratcher hitting her head. The accused then continued to hit the victim's head repeatedly and the victim used both her hands to cover her head... As a result, both the victim's hands were also hit by the wooden scratcher."" Soon after, Ng left for work and Ms Weti continued with her chores even though she was in pain. On Jan 28 last year, a neighbour heard a woman in Ng's flat moaning in pain and suspected Ms Weti was a victim of abuse. The neighbour alerted the police but no one answered the door when officers arrived later that day. The officers returned three days later and saw that the maid was injured and had bloodshot eyes. Ms Weti was taken to Changi General Hospital where she was found with injuries including two fractured fingers on her left hand and bruises over her eyes. She was given medical leave until Feb 2 last year. Court documents did not state where she is now. On Monday, DPP Johannus told the court that Ng had given the maid $12,800 as compensation. He urged Judge Chay to sentence her to at least 10 months' jail and stressed that maids ""constitute a vulnerable class of persons that the courts endeavour to protect"". For causing grievous hurt to the maid, Ng could have been jailed for up to 15 years and fined. ",https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/paralegal-who-fractured-maids-fingers-jailed-10-months,Asia One,,,

The Indonesian Embassy, when contacted, said it would respect and monitor the court process as it was still ongoing because the prosecution has filed an appeal. ""The embassy will not interfere and is confident that the Malaysian legal process will prevail,"" the embassy told The Star. Rozita was initially charged under Section 307 of the Penal Code with attempted murder, facing life imprisonment or up to 20 years in jail. However, the charge was later amended to causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means under Section 326 of the Penal Code which carries imprisonment of up to 20 years. Rozita pleaded guilty to the lesser charge and judge Mohammed Mokhzani Mokhtar sentenced her to be bound over for five years on a good behaviour bond of RM20,000. Deputy public prosecutor V. Suloshani had urged the court to mete out a jail sentence to serve as a deterrent against the accused, adding that the incident had gone viral on social media.

" PETALING JAYA - More than 40,000 people have signed a petition calling for justice to be served equally to the rich and poor after a Datin escaped jail time for abusing her Indonesian domestic worker.

The petition is seeking 50,000 signatures before it is forwarded to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said. Rozita was charged with abusing then 19-year-old Suyanti Sutrinso in 2016 using a kitchen knife, a steel mop, a clothes hanger and an umbrella. She had caused multiple injuries to the victim's head, hands, legs and internal organs between 7am and 12pm on Dec 21, 2016 in a house in Mutiara Damansara. The petition claims that Rozita's actions against Suyanti should have resulted in a ""stricter punishment"" rather than a good behaviour bond.

Datin Rozita Mohamad Ali was instead sentenced to a good behaviour bond for five years by the Sessions Court here. Previously, Rozita had been charged with attempted murder of her maid, Suyanti Sutrinso, using a kitchen knife, a steel mop, a clothes hanger and an umbrella.

" A woman in her 20s, surnamed Kim, poured ramen from a boiling pot on her roommate, surnamed Koo, and threatened her with a weapon on Oct. 24, local media outlets reported Friday. After pouring the boiling contents onto Koo, Kim had threatened the victim with a weapon for an hour, containing her in the house, when the victim was suffering from burns on her face and arms. Witnesses said that Koo was able to ask for help from her downstairs' neighbour. The neighbour immediately called the ambulance and Koo was taken to the emergency room for severe burn treatment. Koo will need treatment for her burns for a year. Photo: The Korea Herald/Asia News Network Kim told police that the assault was essentially due to her discovery of Koo's malicious comments on social media concerning herself to acquaintances. The police, however, decided to close the case, saying that Kim and Koo were both at fault for assault. They did not detain Kim but only urged the two to reconcile with each other. Police said that they reached this conclusion due to the victim being ""unable to speak."" Online commenters expressed their anger and disbelief with regards to the inadequacy and unprofessionalism of the police. Following the online debate on the outcome of the case, it is reported that the police now have filed an arrest warrant for Kim for causing serious injury and forcible containment to her roommate.",https://www.asiaone.com/asia/korean-woman-probed-pouring-boiling-ramen-over-friend,Asia One,,,

Chan Tee Neo was left with a swollen left eye, bleeding nose and abrasion on her left hand after the minor accident at 1.30pm on Saturday. Her son Robert Lim, 53, said the accident occurred along Jalan Melati, a bypass close to Banda Hilir police station.

" Stomp contributor Nick's foot was pierced by a screw that had been inserted into a lemon peel and placed at a service road in front of Block 113 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 at around 1pm yesterday (Jul 31). In a telephone interview, he said that he then saw around 10 similar objects scattered around when he surveyed the area. Nick told Stomp that he was walking his dogs in the HDB estate when he felt that he stepped on something sharp. Upon investigation, he found that a 5cm screw had gone through his sandal and pierced his left foot, leaving him bleeding. Thereafter, two men staying at a ground floor HDB unit came to render assistance. Nick recounted what happened: ""Upon closer inspection, we found that the screw was deliberately inserted into a lemon peel and there were more scattered nearby on the road and some in the grass. ""Altogether we found about 10 of them. ""These have obviously been placed in such a way to puncture car tyres, but it is also extremely dangerous as people can step on them! ""There are a lot of families in the area and lots of children walk by as well. ""There is a playground just 10 metres or so away for crying out loud! ""Just to let everyone know that there are all kinds of sick people in this world, so take care of yourself and your kids and watch where you step. ""I'm in considerable pain, but otherwise fine for now."" ""I encourage anyone who lives or is in the area to be vigilant and make a police report if you see anything similar.""
